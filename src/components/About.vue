      Hi! I am
      <span>Aviral Omar!</span>
    </h1>
    <p>I'm a 19-year old second-year student at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus currently pursuing a Dual Degree (M.Sc.(Hons.) Economics and B.E. Computer Science).</p>
    <p>I began programming at the age of 13 and that is where my love of technology began. I like to regularly keep up with news and advancements in the tech world where something exciting just keeps coming up.</p>
    <p>I have explored several domains of programming such as web development, app development and even desktop app development at one point. In the process, I have learnt and used numerous programming languages like Java, C, C++, Dart, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python along with frameworks like JavaFX, Flutter and Vue.js.</p>
    <p>In the future, I would like to venture deeper into the world of backend development as well as native android app development. I would also like to explore newer and ever-expanding technologies such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
    <p>Apart from technology, I also love to play and follow basketballüèÄÔ∏è.</p>
